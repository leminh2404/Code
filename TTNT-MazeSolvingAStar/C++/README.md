# A-Star-Algorithm-for-2d-Maze-C-11
This repository contains simple C++ 11 implementation of A-Star algorithm for a 2d maze. The maze is hard-coded in the algorithm. The algorithm asks for user input for start node and finds a path to pre-defined goal node which is also hard-coded in the algorithm. Only C++ 11 native data structures are used in this project and there is no usage of other libraries.

# Assumptions
 - You are running a machine with Ubuntu/ Windows/ Macintosh;
 - You have a C++ 11 or later compiler on your machine;
 - You have CMake build system on your machine

# Build and Run Instructions
In a new terminal, do the following :
```
git clone https://github.com/arunumd/A-Star-Algorithm-for-2d-Maze-C-11.git
cd A-Star-Algorithm-for-2d-Maze-C-11.git
mkdir build
cd build
cmake.. && make
./ENPM809Y_PROJECT_5
```
